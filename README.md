# Developer Digest

## Deployed Project:

## About Developer Digest
This is the client for a full CRUD  implementation (server's repository <a href="https://github.com/jsziems/books-server">here</a>).  The application allows developers to track materials they want to read, watch or listen to.  It also allows them to rate the material and provide a summary for future reference.

This app is the final project for a 6-month web development course through Eleven Fifty Academy.


## Technologies include:
* Typescript
* Class Components
* Lifecycle methods
* Props and state management
* Reactstrap

## Using Developer Digest

### Login

Begin by selecting 'Login' from the navbar at the top of the screen, or the 'Click here to get started' button in the middle of the screen.  You'll be prompted for an email address, password, name, and special roles.  Special roles are not essential for using the application, so this can be set to 'None'.

### Create a Resource

Once you've signed up, you can begin entering the items you'd like to track (logging in brings you to this screen, but you can also navigate here using the 'Show Resources' menu option).  The 'Add A Resource' area on the left of the screen is a quick way to enter minimal information about each item.  

### Search for Resources

Each item is displayed on the right portion of the screen.  To filter the items, begin typing words from the title in the Search bar at the top of the screen.  

### Edit a Resource

You can enter additional information about the resource by selecting 'Edit'.  From the edit screen you can update the information provided when the item was created, and can provide other data such as a rating, and a summary.

### Delete a Resource

To remove the resource from Developer Digest, select the Delete button for the resource.

### Update and Delete Users

Users who have the User Admin role will have an 'Admin' option on the navbar.  Select this option to see a listing of the registered Developer Digest users.  Use the 'Update' option to change a user's email address or name.  Select the 'Delete' option to delete a user and their resources.
